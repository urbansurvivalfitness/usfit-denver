                        <h2>Who is Karlee Jakalow?</h2>
                        <p>Southern gal who served in the US Air Force for six years.  
                            After graduating college decided to teach art  to kids in low income areas.  
                            Right now I have been working over 5 years in the Montbello area and before that the inner city of Dallas.  
                            As I got more mature and wiser stresses of life overwhelm me and that is when I  discovered the joys of Power Yoga.  
                            Still being very physically active I loved the combination of still breaking a sweat, with the benefits learning to use breathe to deal with the stress.  
                            Practicing yoga for over 4 years it is now part of my everyday life.  I also love to cook, travel the world and sample beers with wonderful husband Ian.</p>
