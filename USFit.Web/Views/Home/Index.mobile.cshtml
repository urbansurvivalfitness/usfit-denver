                feel I'm getting the best work-out in 50 minutes than I could ever achieve at the

            <p>I rely on the cardio aspect of the group fitness to suppliment my crossfit and olympic
                lifting routines. Plus, Jeff helps me acheive my goals - to look better with my
                shirt off!</p>

            <p>My experience there really gave me the confidence that has fueled my weight loss
                journey. The atmosphere there gave me a new look on working out. The support and
                encouragement from the whole team there was much needed when trying new and challenging
                things. I want to thank everyone there for helping me realize my potential and my
                inner strength.</p>
