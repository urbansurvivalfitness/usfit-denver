            <p>
                The group fitness classes help me train for the triathalons that I run yearly</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>
                This isn't a social club like CAC, Forza, or DAC. We show up on time, get in, work
                our tails off, and get out. You will get out of it, what you put in.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>I rely on the cardio aspect of the group fitness to suppliment my 
                crossfit and olympic lifting routines.  Plus, Jeff helps me acheive my goals - to look better 
                with my shirt off!</p>

            <p>
                My experience there really gave me the confidence that has fueled my weight loss
                journey. The atmosphere there gave me a new look on working out. The support and
                encouragement from the whole team there was much needed when trying new and challenging
                things. I want to thank everyone there for helping me realize my potential and my
                inner strength.</p>
